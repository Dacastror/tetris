## Tetris Game

This is the code for a basic Tetris game made in a short time, shown in this video: [https://youtu.be/wso9CqLmIIs](https://youtu.be/wso9CqLmIIs). This is not an example of writing modular or properly structured code, rather it is an example of what you might do in a technical test where you have very little time to show a functional result.

Basically an html table was used as a board for the game and the necessary logic was added around this.
